My first project with GoLang.

# My Findings

Go is very opinionated - compared to other languages. There is a single, unified style of writing in Go.
I see this as being a massive benefit in teams as there is no need to deal with idiosyncrasies and perosnal styles of programming, it all conforms to one style set out by Go.

I see the hate about Go and don't understand why there is so much hate - perhaps those who push the agenda simply have not embraced Go or have been involved in a meaningful or large enough product using Go instead of writing just "Hello, World!" and judge it off that biased experiment. 

Go seems to be a very fast and scalable language that promotes separation of concerns and a microservice approach, while it can be used to write monolothic applications such as this one.

Go seems to go off the ideology that a language should contain as few features as necessary, for more efficient programming. There is a mental check-out when dealing with traditional languages like Python and Java whereby the solutions are littered everywhere - whether it is Stack Overflow or one of the million books you can read, while Go requires you to think logically and utilise what it has out-of-the-box creating very unique solutions that are quite performant as well.

It's also very easy to google problems with Go, and there is only a few accepted answers because that is the style. There is no variations of doing something that would create confusion or debate, it takes a F.I.F.O. approach and I'm definitely for it.
